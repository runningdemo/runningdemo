How to Get Better At Anything¶

   Better Title

RTFM¶

   RTFM WTFM
     * WTFM, Write The Flip'n Manual
     * Do a lightning talk about it :)

Make it Fun¶

   Surprised Koala Trophy
     * Gamification
     * Trophy anyone?
     * If it can't be made fun, make it fun.

Practice¶

   I've practiced a lot
     * Slowly with intent
     * Pressure cycles: none, some, actual, intolerable.
     * The practice of practice deserves its own talk.

Better not good¶

   Good to Better Chart
     * Good is the killer of better.
     * People tend to stop because good is unreachable.
     * People tend to stop after they're good enough.
     * If we aim to get better, we'll eventually be better than good.
     * Progressive goals. OMG! I forgot goal setting!

Learn, don't Memorize¶

   One does not simply memorize PI
     * Learning is understanding
     * Understanding is connecting the new thing to an old thing.
     * Computers memorize. You're not a computer.

Learn with others¶

   Google Hug
     * With the Internet you're never alone and always alone.
     * Actually talk with people!

Cheat¶

   One does not simply memorize PI
     * If you're not cheating, you're not trying.
     * Reverse engineer the cheat, don't actually cheat!

How I got better at Vim¶

     * RTFM - :help
     * WTFM - Blogging, figure out other people's problems :/
     * Practice - Wrote stuff that wasn't needed immediately, my own
       notes.
     * Don't Memorize - Vim has grammar like English. Oooh...
       Reconnection!
     * Learn with Others - We have vim users, teach them (but don't let
       them know you're only one step ahead)
     * Cheat - Look at other's Vimscript to figure out that cool thing
       they did.

What do you want to get better at next?!?¶

     * lightning talks?
     * Shuffling cards? (@devin)
     * SQL?
     * Drawing?
     * Piano?
